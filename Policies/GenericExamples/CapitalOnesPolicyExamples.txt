 184 ##"""Filter for verifying security group ingress and egress permissions

    All attributes of a security group permission are available as
    value filters.

    If multiple attributes are specified the permission must satisfy
    all of them. Note that within an attribute match against a list value
    of a permission we default to or.

    If a group has any permissions that match all conditions, then it
    matches the filter.

    Permissions that match on the group are annotated onto the group and
    can subsequently be used by the remove-permission action.

    We have specialized handling for matching `Ports` in ingress/egress
    permission From/To range. The following example matches on ingress
    rules which allow for a range that includes all of the given ports.

    .. code-block: yaml

      - type: ingress
        Ports: [22, 443, 80]

    As well for verifying that a rule only allows for a specific set of ports
    as in the following example. The delta between this and the previous
    example is that if the permission allows for any ports not specified here,
    then the rule will match. ie. OnlyPorts is a negative assertion match,
    it matches when a permission includes ports outside of the specified set.

    .. code-block: yaml

      - type: ingress
        OnlyPorts: [22]

    For simplifying ipranges handling which is specified as a list on a rule
    we provide a `Cidr` key which can be used as a value type filter evaluated
    against each of the rules. If any iprange cidr match then the permission
    matches.

    .. code-block: yaml

      - type: ingress
        IpProtocol: -1
        FromPort: 445

    We also have specialized handling for matching self-references in
    ingress/egress permissions. The following example matches on ingress
    rules which allow traffic its own same security group.

    .. code-block: yaml

      - type: ingress
        SelfReference: True

    As well for assertions that a ingress/egress permission only matches
    a given set of ports, *note* OnlyPorts is an inverse match.

    .. code-block: yaml

      - type: egress
        OnlyPorts: [22, 443, 80]

      - type: egress
