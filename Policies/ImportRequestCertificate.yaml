        violation_desc: |
            The ACM Certificate listed below has been deleted as it was created with a low security RSA 1024 bit encryption cipher.
            Having certificates with low security ciphers are easy targets for hackers and should not be used.
        action_desc: |
            Actions Taken - The ACM certificate has been deleted.  A new certificate will need to be created with a RSA encryption cipher of either 2048 or 4096 bit.
